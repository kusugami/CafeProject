# CafeProject
This is a project that my partner and I are currently working on since we hope to open a cafe together one day.

# Update: 10/6/2023
So far, I am working on the basic structure of the website using regular HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. We hope 
to add a user accounts feature at some point to make the shopping part of the page function as a real website would.
